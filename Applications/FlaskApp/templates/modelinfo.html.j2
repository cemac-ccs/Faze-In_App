    Daily simulations are conducted using the <a href="https://www.flexpart.eu">FLEXPART</a> Lagrangian transport model,
    using satellite-derived real-time fire emissions from the <a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/global-fire-emissions">CAMS GFAS (Global Fire Assimilation System)</a> dataset,
    and meteorology from the <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs">NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS4)</a> data.
    <br>
    Within FLEXPART, particles are released from locations matching the 0.1Â° gridcells in GFAS, with an attached PM2.5 mass equal
    to the GFAS emission. GFAS gives daily emissions which been released between midnight and 11pm within the FLEXPART simulation.
    Particles are released between the surface and 750m, to represent the vertical smoke plume.
    <br>
    Particle dispersion is driven by GFS meteorology at 0.5 degree horizontal resolution. The resultant distributions show the
    fire-sourced PM2.5 surface concentrations, at ?? resolution. Note that this does not represent total PM2.5 concentrations,
    since the non-fire sourced PM2.5 contribution is not explicitly simulated.
